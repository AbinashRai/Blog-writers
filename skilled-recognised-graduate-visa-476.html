                  If you are an Australian graduate looking to remain in the
                  country, there are many options available. A student visa will
                  not provide permanent residency, however, a 476 work visa can
                  be applied for. The Skilled Recognised Graduate Visa is a type
                  of work visa that engineering graduates may be eligible to
                  apply for.
                </p>
                <h2>What is a Skilled Recognised Graduate Visa?</h2>
                <p>
                  The Skilled Recognised Graduate Visa (Subclass 476) Australia
                  is a visa that allows recent international graduates from
                  various recognized overseas higher education institutions to
                  work, gain professional experience, and apply for
                  <a href="skilled-migration-to-australia-with-pr"
                    >Skilled Migration to Australia with PR Visa</a
                  >. This visa is designed to attract qualified young
                  professionals to Australia who have the skills and
                  qualifications to contribute to the economy. The visa requires
                  applicants to have completed at least two years of study in
                  the last six years and meet the minimum English language
                  requirements.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The Visa gives you the benefit of being able to live, study
                    and work in Australia for up to 18 months.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If you are applying for the 476 Visa, you can do so regardless
                  of whether you are in or outside Australia. You will need to
                  create an online account on the official website to submit
                  your application along with the necessary documents and
                  application fee. It is important to remember to pay the fee
                  before submitting your application, as the Australian
                  government will not process it without the payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are applying with family members, each individual will
                  be required to pay the processing fee and attach documents
                  that apply to them. Once you have sent in your application,
                  the Australian government will advise you in writing if they
                  have received it. They may also ask for additional
                  information. Do not make any travel plans until you have
                  gotten approval for the 476 Visa. You may also be asked to
                  provide biometric information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, when a decision on your visa application is made, you
                  need to be outside Australia. If your visa is granted, the
                  Australian government will notify you of the visa grant
                  number, the date your visa starts, and your current visa
                  situation.
                </p>

                <p>

                  States of America, New Zealand, Canada, or Ireland).
                  Additionally, you must sign the Australian Value Statement

                        To stay longer in Australia after your 476 visa expires,
                        you will need to apply for another permanent work visa.
                        Depending on which visa you apply for, there may be
                        certain conditions that you must meet. For example, you
                        may need to gain a nomination from an Australian state
                        or territory for a state-nominated visa. Be sure to have
                        a bridging visa if your 476 visa expires while the new
                        visa is being processed.
