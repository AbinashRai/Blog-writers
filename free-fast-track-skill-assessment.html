                  Engineers who possess an engineering degree from a country
                  other than Australia and are not signatories under the Sydney
                  Accord, Washington Accord, or the Dublin Accord, must
                  undertake a Migration Skills Assessment (MSA) to qualify for
                  working in Australia. The Engineers Australia (EA)
                  organization specifically selects candidates with the set of
                  required skills and knowledge applicable to their chosen field
                  of engineering. This is done by assessing the Competency
                  Demonstration Report (CDR) of each engineer, to check their
                  level of talent and know-how in their specialty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The migration Skills Assessment (MSA) application is a
                  point-based system meant to attract highly qualified
                  professionals with the experience to fill Australia's skills
                  gap. The process is generally a long road, taking anywhere
                  from 4-7 months. If speed is a selected factor, applicants
                  have the potential to fast-track their application and receive
                  their results within 20-25 working days. The EA evaluators
                  decide who is eligible by thoroughly examining the Competent
                  Dependent Report (CDR) and will reject or ask for
                  re-submission if any errors are discovered. Thus, it is
                  important to provide a comprehensive, accurate report in order
                  to increase the chances of successful acceptance into the
                  program.
                </p>
                <h2>Eligibility</h2>
                <p>
                  To be eligible for the
                  <a href="#">Migration Skills Assessment</a>, you must possess
                  a qualification related to your nominated occupation and have
                  the necessary employment experience required by the MSA
                  Applicant Guidelines. Additionally, your occupation must also
                  appear on a skilled occupation list with TRA as the relevant
                  assessing authority. If you are applying for the Offshore
                  Skills Assessment Program (OSAP) or the Temporary Skills
                  Shortage (TSS) Skills Assessment Program, you do not need to
                  apply for the MSA.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From 28 February 2022 to 30 June 2023, the Australian
                  Government is offering free, expedited skills assessments To
                  be eligible, you must have been granted one of the following
                  visas:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Family visa</li>
                  <li>Humanitarian visa</li>
                  <li>Partner visa</li>
                  <li>Refugee visa</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  You must also have qualifications or skills in a nominated
                  occupation.
                </p>
                <h2>Factors considered by Skilled Assessment Officials</h2>
                <p>
                  When a Skill Assessment Officer gets an application, they will
                  first make sure the candidate has the correct education,
                  experience, and English language fluency. The officer will
                  look at the occupation the person has put on their
                  application, what qualifications they have that meet the
                  occupationâ€™s criteria, the amount of experience they have, how
                  essential their skills are to their chosen occupation, and
                  which visa category they are applying for.
                </p>

                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How To Fast-Track The Application?</h2>
                <p>
                  If you are looking to receive a fast response from Engineers
                  Australia regarding one of your applications, the premium
                  option offered by them for $275 will provide expedited
                  service. Through this, your application will be forwarded to
                  an assessor within a timeframe of between 5 and 15 working
                  days if you complete it via their online form. However, owing
                  to the sheer number of applications received at once, some
                  delay in evaluations may be experienced, so it is advised that
                  Engineers Australia should not be contacted until the slated
                  time has elapsed. Choosing the premium option decisively cuts
                  down this waiting period to as little as 20 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you have an unaccredited qualification, it can take up to
                  nine weeks before your application is assigned to a case
                  officer by Engineers Australia. For accredited Australian and
                  Accord qualifications, the wait time is reduced to seven
                  weeks. Please note that the times listed are calculated from
                  the time that all necessary information has been provided and
                  may be subject to change depending on the number of
                  applications received.

                <h2>Latest Update and News on Fast Track Skill Assessment</h2>
                <p>
                  Robin Liu, Senior Manager of Assessments at Engineers
                  Australia, said that the new program provides a much quicker
                  assessment than is usually expected- where a regular
                  assessment typically takes 16 to 18 weeks and a paid
                  fast-tracked assessment usually takes 20 working days, this
                  free offer will provide results within 15 working days. Liu,
                  who is a migrant engineer himself, noted that Engineers
                  Australia will be responsible for managing the assessment
                  process for engineers, but that they need to promote this
                  offer to relevant communities to make it successful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those who already possess permanent visas are allowed to work
                  without restriction in Australia, but it is useful for them to
                  familiarize themselves with the assessment process and its
                  importance. We are referring to individuals who have permanent
                  visas but have not been assessed by us previously. The
                  assessment process confirms that the engineer's qualifications
                  are comparable to an Australian engineering degree.
                </p>
                <h2>Is Skill Assessment a Must?</h2>
                <p>
                  All workers who wish to migrate to Australia must have their
                  skills and qualifications assessed by a panel of experts. This
                  process is necessary in order to assess the skill level of the
                  applicant in relation to the job they are applying for. This
                  is an essential step before applying for an Australian
                  Permanent Residency. If you have any questions about the skill
                  assessment requirements for migration to Australia, our team
                  of experts is always available to help.
