                  The ANZSCO stands for Australian and New Zealand Standard
                  Classification of Occupations. The joint effort of the
                  Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Statistics New Zealand,
                  and Department of Education and Training developed it. ANZSCO
                  is a classification system that is aimed to categorize all
                  professions, employment and occupations in the Australian and
                  New Zealand labor market based on various skill levels.
                </p>
                <h2>ANZSCO Code for Engineers:</h2>
                <p>
                  If an engineer wants to Skill Migrate to Australia, then their
                  occupation has to follow the
                  <a href="#">ANZSCO Code</a> categorized by Engineers
                  Australia. The scope of ANZSCO is all occupations and jobs in
                  Australia and New Zealand labor markets taken forward for pay
                  or profit. They exclude occupations that are illegal in
                  Australia and New Zealand from ANZSCO.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ANZSCO Code occupation is necessary for the CDR Skill
                  Assessment, which is required to check if your skills meet the
                  standard that the authorities set to work in relevant
                  occupation. Identifying the right ANZSCO code can be a
                  confusing task for the Engineers.
                </p>
                <p>

                <h2>ANZSCO Structure</h2>
                <p>
                  They categorized the ANZSCO structure into five hierarchy
                  levels:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Major Group</li>
                  <li>Sub-major Group</li>
                  <li>Minor Group</li>
                  <li>Unit Group</li>
                  <li>Occupation</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  The Major Group is the broadest level of ANZSCO. Sub-major
                  group is a subdivision of Major group. The Minor Group is a
                  subdivision of the Sub-major group, followed by the Unit
                  Group, which is a subdivision of the Minor Group.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Occupation is the most detailed level of ANZSCO and the
                  subdivision of the Unit Group. The concept of occupation is
                  based on the concepts of ANZSCO skill level.
                </p>
                <h2>ANZSCO Skill Level</h2>
                <p>
                  ANZSCO Skill Level is defined as a function of the range and
                  complexity of the set of tasks performed in a specific
                  occupation. The higher the range and complexity of the tasks,
                  the higher the skill level of an occupation. Skill level is
                  measured based on following factors:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    The level or amount of formal education, schooling and
                    training,
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The amount of experience in previous related occupation,
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The amount of on-the-job training required to competently
                    perform the set of duties required for that occupation.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  ANZSCO does not measure the skill level of an individual;
                  rather, it measures the skill level of a particular
                  occupation. ANZSCO rates the level of skill from 1 to 5 based
                  on the competence level of each relevant occupation. This was
                  determined from the collective advice sought from employers,
                  industry training bodies, professional organizations and
                  others to ensure that the information is as accurate, reliable
                  and meaningful as possible. The five ANZSCO Skill levels are
                  distinguished based on following definitions:
                </p>
                <p>Skill Level 1:</p>
                <p>
                  Occupations at Skill Level 1 should have a skill equivalent to
                  a bachelorâ€™s degree or higher qualification. At least five
                  years of relevant experience can be used as a substitution for
                  formal qualification. In some cases, relevant experience
                  and/or on-the-job training may also be necessary besides the
                  standard formal qualification.
                </p>
                <p>Skill Level 2:</p>
                <p>
                  Occupations at Skill Level 2 should have a skill equivalent to
                  anyone of the following levels:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>NZ Register Diploma,</li>
                  <li>AQF Associate Degree, Advanced Diploma or Diploma.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  At least three years of relevant experience can be used as a
                  substitution for the above mentioned academic qualifications.
                  In some cases, relevant experience and/or on-the-job training
                  may also be necessary besides the standard formal
                  qualification.
                </p>
                <p>Skill Level 3:</p>
                <p>
                  Occupations at Skill Level 3 should have a skill equivalent to
                  anyone of the following levels:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>NZ Register Level 4 qualification,</li>
                  <li>AQF Certificate IV,</li>
                  <li>
                    AQF Certificate III in addition to at least two years of
                    on-the-job training.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  At least three years of relevant experience can be used as a
                  substitution for the above mentioned academic qualifications.
                  In some cases, relevant experience and/or on-the-job training
                  may also be necessary besides the standard formal
                  qualification.
                </p>
                <p>Skill Level 4:</p>
                <p>
                  Occupations at Skill Level 4 should have a skill equivalent to
                  anyone of the following levels:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>NZ Register Level 2 or 3 qualification,</li>
                  <li>AQF Certificate II or III.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  At least one year of relevant experience can be used as a
                  substitution for the above mentioned academic qualifications.
                  In some cases, relevant experience may also be necessary
                  besides the standard formal qualification.
                </p>
                <p>Skill Level 5:</p>
                <p>
                  Occupations at Skill Level 5 should have a skill equivalent to
                  anyone of the following levels:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>NZ Register Level 1 qualification,</li>
                  <li>AQF Certificate I,</li>
                  <li>Compulsory secondary education.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  For some occupations, a short period of on-the-job training
                  may be required, including or instead of the formal
                  qualification. In some cases, no on-the-job training or formal
                  qualification may be required.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is also important for you to have a job offer on the Long
