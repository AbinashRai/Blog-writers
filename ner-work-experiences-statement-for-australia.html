          <p>
            The full form of NER is the National Engineer Register. The
            <a href="#">National Engineer Register</a> (NER) is a professional
            directory of engineers and engineering-related professionals
            registered with Engineering. It is a searchable public database
            providing information on the qualifications, experience and
            specializations of engineers and engineering-related professionals.
            The register is also used to help employers find suitable candidates
            for engineering positions.
          </p>

          <h3>How to write a NER Work Experience Statement?</h3>

          <p>
            When writing your Work Experience Statement (WES) for NER Australia,
            there are a few important points to keep in mind:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Make sure you list your work experience chronologically.</li>
            <li>Start with the most relevant or recent experience.</li>
            <li>
              Make sure that you have at least 5 years of engineering
              experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clearly state the responsibilities, roles, and critical
              achievements of each position.
            </li>
            <li>
              Summarize any lengthy past positions at the end of your WES.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These things should be mentioned in experience statements for NER
            Australia.
          </p>

          <h3>Referee Details In Work Experience Statement</h3>

          <p>
            Please provide two professional referees with engineering degrees
            and at least five years of experience in your area of practice. One
            should be from your current employer and the other either from a
            previous employer if you have been in the current job for less than
            five years or an external mentor. Please include their title, name,
            organization, position, professional relationship, phone number,
            mobile number, and email address. In the context of a work
            experience statement for Australia, a statutory declaration may be
            required to verify the authenticity of the information provided in
            the statement. The person making the declaration may be required to
            affirm that the information provided in the statement is true and
            correct to the best of their knowledge and belief.
          </p>

          <h3>Competence Self-Assessment Worksheet (optional)</h3>

          <p>
            You have the choice to include your Competence Self-Assessment
            Worksheet with your NER application. This worksheet evaluates your
            capabilities in four engineering areas: Commitment, Community
            Responsibility, Value in the Workplace, and Technical Expertise.
            Assign yourself a rank of 'Developing', 'Functional', or
            'Proficiency' for each qualification.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              'Developing' indicates that you are still learning the practice
              area with the assistance of more experienced people and possibly
              supervision.
            </li>
            <li>
              'Functional' means you possess the fundamental capacity to
              practice independently at an acceptable level without help or
              supervision.
            </li>
            <li>
              'Proficient' implies that your independent practice capability has
              been formally recognized through peer review, and you can aid
              others in developing their competency. Competence Self-Assessment
              Worksheet (optional).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Criteria</h3>

          <p>
            The NER registrant has demonstrated their technical proficiency in
            the area(s) of practice shown in the "Evidence" section of this
            badge. They hold an accredited 4-year Bachelor's Degree in

            registrants are obliged to comply with the Professional Development
            requirements corresponding to a minimum of 150 hours of relevant
            professional development activities over the last 3 years of their
            career which should mention the key achievements.
          </p>

          <p>
            They have also been assessed to be competent to the accepted
            standard of an independent practitioner, in terms of five
            competencies:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Dealing with Ethical Issues</li>
            <li>Practicing Competently</li>
            <li>Developing Safe and Sustainable Solutions</li>
            <li>Identifying and Managing Risks</li>
            <li>Local Engineering Knowledge.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Furthermore, they are expected to abide by Engineers Australia's
            Code of Ethics and have their registration renewed annually to
            remain valid. Once these requirements have been fulfilled, NER
            registrants will be able to use the postnominal NER after their
            name. You can
